<h1>Setting up your environment</h1>
Expo used to run application. I believe the process to run goes 1) install expo-cli 2) then you should be able to run 'expo start' from root, the config files should work throughout.

<h2>Naming Pratices</h2>
Places that people suggest are "Spots"
Filters are split in the three main "Activities", and every other filter is just known by its name
